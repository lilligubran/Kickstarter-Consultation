### Data cleaning and Preperation

In the intiial data preperation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling null values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### EDA and Data Analysis

EDA involved in exploring Kickstarter campaigns

- What's the best length of time to run a campaign?
- What's the ideal pledge goal?
- What type of projects would be most successful at getting funded?
- Is there an ideal month/day/time to launch a campaign?

For this project I anlyzed what it takes to create a successful Kickstarter campaign. I identified what you should do and what you should avoid if you plan on starting a Kickstarter project to raise money.
